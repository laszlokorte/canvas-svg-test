Canvas vs SVG experiment
========================

This is just a small experiment to explore the advantages and disadvantages of using canvas or SVG for rendering simple interactive visualizations.

## Usage

Just open the index.html in your Browser. You should see two graphs. One drawn on a canvas and one built with SVG. You can drag the state bubbles with your mouse.
