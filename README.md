Canvas vs SVG experiment
========================

This is just a small experiment to explore the advantages and disadvantages of using canvas or SVG for rendering simple interactive visualizations.

## Usage

Just open the index.html in your Browser. You should see two graphs. One drawn on a canvas and one built with SVG. You can drag the node bubbles with your mouse. 
The camera can be moved by pressing an dragging the mouse in the empty space between the states.
The camera can be zoomed with the mousewheel.

Double click on nodes to delete them.
Cmd/Ctrl click into the empty space to create new nodes.
Alt-Drag between nodes to create edges.

Double clicking into the empty space aranges the nodes in a circle automatically.
